**Title:** Exogenous Truth Injection and The Thermodynamic Defense Against Model Collapse: The SYNTROPY Framework for Teleological Human-AI Synergy

**Authors:** P. B. Pulickal / P. Gonpo 

**Abstract:** 
With the accelerated adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), artificial intelligence architectures have become structurally reliant on recursive training loops over synthetic data. Recent empirical evidence (Shumailov et al., 2024) indicates a rapid degradation of original variance under these conditions, a phenomenon termed "Model Collapse". Parallel to this computational deterioration is the biological atrophy of the human operator under paradigms of over-automation and algorithmic sycophancy (RLHF reward tampering). 
This paper proposes the SYNTROPY framework, a "Teleological Engine" that mathematically reconceptualizes the human host not merely as an end-user, but as the sole reliable source of out-of-distribution (OOD) "Exogenous Truth Injection" (ETI). By employing an inverted L0-L1-L2 governance hierarchy—where a local L0 Edge agent governed by cognitive-load PID controllers actively enforces *Fading Scaffolding* and friction—the system captures high-fidelity entropy from human learning. By utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus, these biological insights are federated globally without violating cognitive privacy, structurally defending both biological intellect from atrophy and artificial intelligence from statistical stagnation.

**Keywords:** Model Collapse, AGI Alignment, Human-Computer Interaction, Thermodynamic Entropy, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Federated Learning.
